                Over the past few decades, the United States has seen a rise in suicide rates 
                despite the increase in awareness and available resources. This dataset tracks 
                the trend from 1999 to 2019 and includes the Age-Adjusted Rate which is used for 
                this visualization.

            <div id="p-div">
                <div id="p-yes">
                    <p>
                        The left chart argues that the suicide rate is rising. This is done by
                        plotting the average rate across all the states on a yearly basis (shown in red) 
                        and each individual state's rate (shown in light grey). This was done to put into 
                        perspective the maximum rates in order to amplify the argument.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="p-no">
                    <p>
                        The right chart argues that the suicide rate is not rising. By changing the 
                        domain of the y axis to fit a wider set of values, the plotted line gives the appearance 
                        of staying somewhat consistent or at least trending upward an insignificant ammount. This 
                        is also done by selecting a few states from the set whos trends were slower than the rest.
